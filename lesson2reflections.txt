What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git object which houses the Git metadata and is required to start tracking file changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area gives me an intermediary spot to place files and inspect them prior to pushing them into a repository with the commit.
