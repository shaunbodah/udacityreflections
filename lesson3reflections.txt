When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I might want to have a remote repository when working on the same program from multiple machines, or when collaborating with a group or soliciting feedback from other developers.  UPDATE:  save my programming online to preserve work in the event of a machine failure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Just like before, I want to review and incorporate changes manually to ensure the integrity of my code and avoid any contamination by unwanted changes proposed by others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are distint sets of commits that are separate from each other.  Clones are copies of repositories, typically to share or move between machines. Forks are copies of repositories in Github, shared between collaborators.
