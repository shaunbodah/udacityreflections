When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I might want to have a remote repository when working on the same program from multiple machines, or when collaborating with a group or soliciting feedback from other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Just like before, I want to review and incorporate changes manually to ensure the integrity of my code and avoid any contamination by unwanted changes proposed by others.
